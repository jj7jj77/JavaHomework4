/*Assume that a gallon of paint covers about 350 square feet of wall space. Create an
application with a main() method that prompts the user for the length, width, and
height of a rectangular room. Pass these three values to a method that does the
following:
Calculates the wall area for a room
Passes the calculated wall area to another method that calculates and returns the
number of gallons of paint needed
Displays the number of gallons needed
Computes the price based on a paint price of $32 per gallon, assuming that the
painter can buy any fraction of a gallon of paint at the same price as a whole gallon
Returns the price to the main() method
The main() method displays the final price. For example, the cost to paint a 15-by-
20-foot roomwith 10-foot ceilings is $64. Save the application as PaintCalculator.java.*/
